# A Tribe Called **Huu**
This is a book about a people called the Huu. Who live on a planet in Multiverse X

The Huu live remotely from another people called **the greatmasse**. And for good reason.

No one undersands why but the greatmasse constantly cause harm to each other, under a veil of saving each other. Usually this harm is done on a system wide scale causing suffering for the entire population.

Knowing this very well the Huu observe the greatmasse from a distance, learning what **not** to do, so they can maintain fulfilling lives while not harming each other.

The huu are well aware that 'helping others' or 'saving the planet' will only cause more suffering. As a first duty, the Huu live by working out how they can get their own house in order and consider carefully the unintended consequences of helping.

They have figured out the only activity which does work with others, is love - the act of doing something for the good of it. Rather than to help or for the expectation of some kind of reward in return. The Huu are well aware that giving love is extremely hard to do.

The greatmasse mock the Huu, calling them foolish, naive, weak and arrogant.

There is a difference between the Huu and the greatmasse: the greatmasse always requires some kind of controlling master figure. This master gives the greatmasse what they feel is the security necessary to make progress. Be that democratic government, a despotic tyrant or even an imaginary father figure in heaven doing the bidding of the democrat and tyrant in a hoped for afterlife. This master of protection is always powered by force and punishment. Whichever it takes, the greatmasse insist they have a powerful master of some kind protecting them. 

There is only one theory about why the greatmasse cause so much harm to each other under a veil of saving the world that has stood the test of time. Over the aeons, Multiverse X has developed a staggerinly productive economy. So productive that there's more wealth available per person, than in all of history, in spite of a growing population. No longer do the people need to fear shortages of anything, or a short miserable life as of old. Now, finally, there exists an opportuity for all to gain equality in terms of wealth and power.

But though this abudnance of wealth is a great miracle, something has been lost in their evolution socially - this society has lost the spirit of struggle and suffering due to no longer needing to try hard to make way. The greatmasse are left with a feeling of entitlement. And all problems the greatmasse face must be blamed on a master of some kind, rather than a swift look in the mirror. All remaining problems are projected onto the government. Not their own freely chosen government but an imaginary oponents government. 

So the greatmasse have developed into a needy race, forever waiting to be bailed out by government as if spoiled children. So needy that they are easy to exploit by the worst among them who tend to rise more quickly to the top. The people have become slaves in spite of great wealth and through their own doing. Wealthslaves. Given this position does so much harm to the psyche of the collective, the tendency is for the greatmasse to project its worst self onto those least able to defend themselves, under a veil of helping others. Astonishingly actions and protests to save a particular tribe, save the planet from ecological destruction, or to bail out the poorest classes, etc etc... ends up wth the greatmasses exploiting the very same people they're claiming to help, the most of all.

And given this is an objective fact of their collective psyche, it is never seen by them. Its been rendered unconsious by whatever ideology the tribe prefers to inform their thought in that time and place. So the greatmasses can never be attended to it even in the smallest way. Only the incite gained from an individual taking huge social risks. By making a stand and pointing it all out with clarity and drive through through the mental resistance, punching the face of hypocrisy square on. Its a huge risk because ones wealth, career, friendships and family are the very high stakes which need to be bid in this ulitmate game of social life.

The Huu do not have a master of anykind at all and do not suffer in the same way. Social organisation for the Huu has no royal court or hierarchy. Their society flourishes and their economy grows, anyway.
