## A Constantly Evolving Story About **the Huu**
This is a book about a people calld the huu.

The Huu live remotely from another people called The Greatmasse for good reason.

The Greatmasse, for reasons unknown, constantly cause harm to each other, under a veil of saving each other. Usually this harm is done on a system wide scale causing suffering for the entire population.

So The Huu, knowing this very well, observe The Greatmasse from a distance, learning what **not** to do. So they can maintain fulfilling lives while not harming each other.

The Huu are well aware that 'helping others' or 'saving the planet' will only cause more suffering. The Huu live by working out how they can impove themselves  before resorting to helping others.

They have figured out the only activity which does work with others, is love - the act of doing something for the good of it. Rather than for the expectation of some thing or some reward in return.

The Huu call this ***The Golden Rule***. The Greatmasse call it foolish, naive, weak or searching for perfection.
