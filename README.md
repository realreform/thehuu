# A Tribe Called **Huu**
This is a book about a people called the Huu. Who live on a planet in Multiverse X

The Huu live remotely from another people called **the greatmasse**. And for good reason.

No one undersands why the greatmasse constantly cause harm to each other, and always under a veil of saving each other. Usually this harm is done on a system wide scale causing suffering for the entire population of the planet.

Knowing this very well the Huu observe the greatmasse from a distance, learning what **not** to do, so they can maintain fulfilling lives while not harming each other.

The huu are well aware that 'helping others' or 'saving the planet' will only cause more suffering. As a first duty, the Huu live by working out how they can get their own house in order and consider carefully the unintended consequences of helping or saving the world.

They have figured out the only activity which does work with others, is love - the act of doing something for the good of it. Rather than to help or for the expectation of some kind of reward in return. The Huu are well aware that giving love is extremely hard to do.

The greatmasse mock the Huu, calling them foolish, naive, weak and arrogant. "Look at the Huu, they are seeking perfection, Nirvana". The Huu ignore this seeing it as the kind of cosy escape route taken by anyone not serious about their planet saving.

There is a fundamental difference between the Huu and the greatmasse. The greatmasse always require some kind of controlling master figure. This master gives the greatmasse what they feel is the security necessary to make progress. Be that democratic government, a despotic tyrant or even an imaginary father figure in heaven doing the bidding of the democrat and tyrant in a hoped for afterlife. This master of protection is always powered by force and punishment. Whichever it takes, the greatmasse insist they have a powerful master of some kind protecting them. 

There is only one theory about why the greatmasse cause so much harm to each other under a veil of saving the world that has stood the test of time. Over the aeons, Multiverse X has developed a staggeringly productive economy. So productive that there's more wealth available per person, than in all of history, in spite of a growing population. No longer do the people need to fear shortages of anything, or a short miserable life as of old. Now, finally, there exists an opportuity for all to gain by no longer fearing shortages of anything. But the greatmasse never grasp the opportunity, only submitting yet more of their freedom to whomever is their master and acting more fearfully than ever before. 

Its a crazy planet. Becuase theres now no longer even any need to fear death any more. The struggle for wealth and power has always been about fearing death. Power acts as a proxy for immortality. Wealth as a sub proxy for power. There is no longer a shortgage of anything at all, wealth and power cannot save you from fear of death any more if they are no longer required. Sadly, this astonshingly easy observation is rendered into the unconsious for the shadows to attend to.

The consequence is that the already powerful become more powerful. This elevation in power allows them to become supremely righteous too.  Their all knowing and seeing policy is to reinforce the idea that 'being seen to be saving the world' in some way, is the first duty or every citizen in the greatmasse. Even if history repeatedly testifies to the utterly frutiless futility of planet saving.

When the evil mythical being known as Sauron wears The Ring life will become harder for people. When the righteous wear it, is when the entire planet is in imminent danger.

So though this abudnance of wealth is a great miracle, something has been lost in their evolution socially - this society has lost the spirit of struggle and suffering due to no longer needing to try hard to make way. The greatmasse are left with a feeling of entitlement. And all problems the greatmasse face must be blamed on a master of some kind, rather than a swift look in the mirror. All remaining problems are projected onto their master, government, wealth and power, or the poor. Onto whomever it will most easily stick. Not always their own freely chosen master or government but an imaginary oponents government. A cosy escape route.

So the greatmasse have developed into a needy race, forever waiting to be bailed out by their master as if spoiled children who cannot have their toys. So needy that they are easy to exploit by the worst among them who tend to rise more quickly to the top. The people have become slaves in spite of great wealth and through their own doing. Wealthslaves. Given this position does so much harm to the psyche of the greatmasse, the tendency is for the greatmasse to project its worst self onto those least able to defend themselves, under a veil of helping others. Astonishingly actions and protests to save a particular tribe, save the planet from ecological destruction, or to bail out the poorest classes, ends up with the greatmasses exploiting the very same thing they're claiming to save, more than ever before.

And given this is an objective fact of their collective psyche, it is never seen by them. Its been rendered unconscious by whatever ideology the tribe prefers to inform their thought in that time and place. So the greatmasses can never be attended to it even in the smallest way. Only the incite gained from an individual taking the huge social risk of rejecting all masters and ideals. Speaking truth to the weak. And driving through the innevitable resistance that will bring, Its a huge risk because ones wealth, career, friendships and family are the very high stakes which need to be bid in this ulitmate game of social life.

Some brave souls have tried it. But always fall quickly when their own wealth and power is put at risk. They neither love nor are authentic people who will ever want to join the Huu.

The Huu do not have a master of anykind at all and do not suffer in the same way. Social organisation for the Huu has no royal court or hierarchy. Their society flourishes and their economy grows, anyway.
