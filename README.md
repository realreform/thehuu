# A Constantly Evolving Story About **The Huu**
This is a book about a people called the huu.

The huu live remotely from another people called **the greatmasse**. And for good reason.

No one undersands why but the greatmasse constantly cause harm to each other, under a veil of saving each other. Usually this harm is done on a system wide scale causing suffering for the entire population.

Knowing this very well the huu observe the greatmasse from a distance, learning what **not** to do. To maintain fulfilling lives while not harming each other. Knowing how to stop harming ohers comes for free. There's no cost to it, one just stops doing the harm.

The huu are well aware that 'helping others' or 'saving the planet' will only cause more suffering. As a first duty, the huu live by working out how they can get their own house in order and consider carefully the unintended consequences of helping.

They have figured out the only activity which does work with others, is love - the act of doing something for the good of it. Rather than to help or for the expectation of some kind of reward in return. The huu are well aware that giving love is extremely hard to do.

The greatmasse mock the hu and call them foolish, naive, weak or searching for perfection.

There is one big social difference between The huu and the greatmasse: the greatmasse always requires some kind of controlling master figure. This master gives the greatmasse what they feel is the security necessary to make progress. Be that democratic government, a despotic tyrant or even an imaginary father figure in heaven doing the bidding of the democrat and tyrant in a hoped for afterlife. This master of protection is always powered by force and punishment. Whichever form it takes, the greatmasse insist they have a powerful master of some kind protecting them. 

Whereas, the huu do not have a master of anykind at all. Social organisation for the huu has no royal court or herarchy. Their society flourishes and their economy grows, anyway.
