## A Constantly Evloving Story About **The Huu**
This is a book about a people calld The Huu.

The Huu live remotely from another people called The Greatmasse for good reason.

The Greatmasse, for reasons unknown, constantly cause harm to each other, under a veil of saving each other. Usually this harm is done on a system wide scale causing suffering for the entire population.

So The Huu, knowing this very well, observe The Greatmasse from a distance, learning what **not** to do. So they can maintain fulfilling lives while not harming each other.

The Huu are well aware that 'helping others' or 'saving the planet' will only cause more suffering. The Huu live by working out how they can impove themselves  before resorting to helping others.

They have figured out the only activity which does work with others, is love - the act of doing something for the good of it. Rather than for the expectation of some thing or some reward in return.

The Huu call this ***The Golden Rule***. The Greatmasse call it foolish, naive, weak or searching for perfection.

There is a fundamental difference between The huu and the greatmasse. The greatmasse always requires some kind of controlling master figure, giving them what they feel is the security necessary to make progress. Be that democratic government with the rule of law and the huge dead weight costs which come with that. Or a despotic tyrant who explicitly forces what government does imlicitly. Or even an imaginary father figure in heaven doing the bidding of the democrat and tyrant in a hoped for afterlife. Whichever it is, the greatmasse insist as a collective of people they have a master of some kind telling others how to love each other by force. 

Whereas, the huu do not have a master of anykind at all. And their social organisation flourishes and their economy grows, nevertheless.
