# A Tribe Called **Huu**
This is a book about a people called the huu. Who live on a planet in Multiverse X

The huu live remotely from another people called **the greatmasse**. And for good reason.

No one undersands why but the greatmasse constantly cause harm to each other, under a veil of saving each other. Usually this harm is done on a system wide scale causing suffering for the entire population.

Knowing this very well the huu observe the greatmasse from a distance, learning what **not** to do, so they can maintain fulfilling lives while not harming each other.

The huu are well aware that 'helping others' or 'saving the planet' will only cause more suffering. As a first duty, the huu live by working out how they can get their own house in order and consider carefully the unintended consequences of helping.

They have figured out the only activity which does work with others, is love - the act of doing something for the good of it. Rather than to help or for the expectation of some kind of reward in return. The huu are well aware that giving love is extremely hard to do.

The greatmasse mock the hu, calling them foolish, naive, weak and arrogant.

There is a difference between the huu and the greatmasse: the greatmasse always requires some kind of controlling master figure. This master gives the greatmasse what they feel is the security necessary to make progress. Be that democratic government, a despotic tyrant or even an imaginary father figure in heaven doing the bidding of the democrat and tyrant in a hoped for afterlife. This master of protection is always powered by force and punishment. Whichever it takes, the greatmasse insist they have a powerful master of some kind protecting them. 

There is only one theory about why the greatmasse cause so much harm to each other, under a veil of saving the world, that has stood the test of time. Over the aeons, Multiverse X has developed a staggerinly productive economy. So productive that there's more wealth than in all history in spite of a growing population. No longer do the people need to fear shortages of anything, or a short miserable life as of old. Though this abudnance of wealth is a great miracle, something has been lost in their evolution socially - this society has lost the spirit of struggle and suffering. All of that has long ago been mitigated by their master and the people are left with a feeling of pure entitlement governing their psyche. All remaining problems are projeced onto the government or 'they's'. And the people now behave as wealth slaves.

The huu do not have a master of anykind at all and do not suffer in the same way. Social organisation for the huu has no royal court or herarchy. Their society flourishes and their economy grows, anyway.
